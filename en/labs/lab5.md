**GreenField Technologies — SoilSense Project**

**Phase:** Integration

**Duration:** 3 hours

**ISO lens:** Enterprise system pattern (Table A.3, Figure A.5) + enterprise networking pattern (Table A.4, Figure A.6) — IoT gateway + the four networks (proximity / access / services / user)

---

## 1. Project Context

**From:** Daniela (Pilot Customer) via Product Team — *"I can check soil temperature in the field with my laptop, but I'm at the market and the dashboard on my phone is dead. The mesh is an island."*

You shipped efficient uplink in [Lab 3](lab3.md) (`/env/temp`, CoAP/CBOR + Observe) and reliable downlink in [Lab 4](lab4.md) (`/act/valve`, CON + SED). Both contracts live **inside the Thread mesh**. The phone, the cloud, the auditor's laptop — none of them speak 802.15.4. **Mission:** deploy an **OpenThread Border Router (OTBR)** that bridges the proximity network (Thread/6LoWPAN) to the access network (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) and onward to services and user networks. No new resource — same `/env/temp` and `/act/valve`, now reachable from outside.

| Stakeholder | Their question | How this lab answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Daniela (Farmer)** | Can I see this on my phone from the market? | The OTBR advertises a global IPv6 prefix to the mesh and NAT64-translates to the IPv4 internet. |
| **Edwin (Ops)** | If the cloud dies, does the field still work? | The mesh keeps operating; only off-mesh reach is lost. Local-first is structural, not optional. |
| **Samuel (Architect)** | Where does the boundary live and what does it cost? | One device, one diagram (Table A.4). You measure the per-hop latency it adds. |
| **ISO 30141 Auditor** | Which networks are chained, and what crosses the boundary? | You produce the §3 four-network walk for the DDR. |

## 2. ISO/IEC 30141 placement

**The lens just changed.** Labs 1–4 climbed the Functional viewpoint's domain ladder (PED → SCD → ASD). Today's artifacts are two paired patterns from Annex A of ISO/IEC 30141:2024, designed as a pair (the standard says the networking pattern *"uses"* the system pattern):

- **§A.4 / Table A.3 / Figure A.5 — enterprise system pattern**: names the **IoT gateway**. The OTBR is the canonical SoilSense IoT gateway.
- **§A.5 / Table A.4 / Figure A.6 — enterprise networking pattern**: the *four networks* — proximity, access, services, user.

The Border Router *is* what those two tables draw together: an IoT gateway on the boundary between proximity and access.

**Four networks, one device at the seam.** The OTBR has a foot in two of them (proximity, access); services and user are downstream and outside your code, but the deliverable shows the whole chain.

**The standard names the OTBR's job** (Table A.3, quote this verbatim in your DDR §4): *"IoT gateways are devices which connect SCD with other domains. IoT gateways provide functions such as protocol conversion, address mapping, data processing, information fusion, certification, and equipment management."* Score the OTBR against those six:

| Table A.3 function | In SoilSense today |
|---|---|
| Protocol conversion | ✅ NAT64 for IPv4 (the CoAP bytes themselves cross unchanged) |
| Address mapping | ✅ global-prefix SLAAC + the NAT64 `64:ff9b::/96` translation |
| Certification | ✅ Thread commissioning trust anchor (network key + PSKc in the BR's dataset) |
| Equipment management | ✅ `ot child table` / `ot router table` / `ot netdata show` on the BR's CLI |
| Data processing | ⏳ the OTBR forwards, it doesn't aggregate — Lab 7 |
| Information fusion | ⏳ Lab 7 |

**Placement.** Figure A.5 draws the "IoT gateway" box **inside the SCD** — the OTBR is an SCD entity, *not* RAID. **RAID** (Resource Access & Interchange — access management + interchange to outside consumers) lights up in Lab 6 (DTLS) and Lab 7 (the dashboard API), not here. Don't conflate the three structures: viewpoints (six) ≠ domains (six inside Functional) ≠ patterns (A.1–A.5).

**Functional / management plane separation (ISO §6.2.2.3.3):** the OTBR runs both planes side-by-side on one device. The **functional plane** forwards CoAP/UDP packets between proximity and access. The **management plane** advertises the global prefix to the mesh (SLAAC), advertises mesh routes to the Wi-Fi side (RA), and exposes commissioning + topology over the `ot` CLI on the BR's serial console. Changing commissioning state via `ot commissioner` does not disturb in-flight `coap put` traffic on the functional plane.

## 3. The networking-pattern artifact — four networks walked end-to-end

This is the artifact you cite in ADR-005 and add to your DDR §4 (ISO Mapping → enterprise networking pattern, Table A.4). It is the deliverable that replaces Lab 3/4's API contract — there is no new resource today, only a new path the existing ones can travel.

| Network (Table A.4 / Figure A.6) | What it is in SoilSense | Address you see | Crosses *into* the next network via |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Proximity** | Thread mesh from Lab 2; nodes from Lab 3/4 | mesh-local EID `fd<...>::N` | OTBR's 802.15.4 ↔ Wi-Fi/Ethernet bridge |
| **Access** | The OTBR + the Wi-Fi AP / Ethernet LAN it joins | OTBR global IPv6 + Wi-Fi local IPv4 | OTBR's NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`) and home router |
| **Services** | Cloud CoAP endpoint (or a local Python CoAP server on your laptop) | Public IPv4 / IPv6 | Cloud↔phone path; outside scope |
| **User** | Phone / browser viewing dashboard | Whatever the carrier hands out | — |

**Bytes-on-the-wire policy.** No new payload contract today — the `/env/temp` 6-byte CBOR and the `/act/valve` 4-byte CBOR cross **unchanged** across the boundary. The OTBR is a **network-layer** bridge, not an application-layer proxy. If the bytes change at the boundary, it's because you added a CoAP↔HTTP proxy on top — and that's a Lab 7 concern, not today's.

**Addressing rule for the lab.** Before the OTBR forms, your nodes only had **mesh-local** addresses (`fd<...>::N`, only valid inside the mesh). After the OTBR advertises a global prefix, every node gains a second IPv6 address with that prefix — that's the address an external client uses to reach it. `ipaddr` on a node will show **both**; `ipaddr mleid` returns the mesh-local one.

## 4. Execution

The Border Router is built from **two boards working as one device**: a Wi-Fi-capable host (ESP32 classic *recommended* — preserves every C6 for the mesh — or ESP32-S3 if your group has one) running the OTBR firmware, and an ESP32-C6 flashed as **RCP (Radio Co-Processor)** — a "dumb modem" that gives the host access to the 802.15.4 radio. SOP-05 walks the flash + bring-up; the `examples/openthread/ot_br` and `ot_rcp` examples are the same ones Espressif ships. **You author no C** — this lab is configuration and verification from the `ot` CLI on the BR's serial monitor and on each node's monitor. The Lab 2 mesh, the Lab 3 sensor server, and the Lab 4 valve server all stay running on their existing C6 boards.

### Task A — OTBR bring-up and mesh commissioning

- Flash the RCP firmware to one ESP32-C6 ([SOP-05 §1](sops/sop05_border_router.md#1-flash-the-radio-co-processor-rcp)).
- Flash the OTBR firmware to the BR host (ESP32 or S3) with the RCP wired in ([SOP-05 §2](sops/sop05_border_router.md#2-flash-and-launch-the-otbr-host)).
- From the BR's `ot` CLI in `idf.py monitor`, **connect Wi-Fi** (`ot wifi connect -s … -p …`), then **form** a Thread network (`ot dataset init new`, set a non-default PAN ID and network key, `ot ifconfig up`, `ot thread start`), then **start the BR** (`ot br init 1 1`). Full walkthrough in [SOP-05 §3](sops/sop05_border_router.md#3-bring-up-wi-fi-and-form-the-thread-network--from-the-ot-cli).
- Re-commission your **Lab 3 Node A** (sensor) and **Lab 4 Node V** (valve) onto this OTBR-formed network by pasting the BR's `ot dataset active -x` hex blob.
- **Evidence:** BR-side `ot child table` + `ot router table` output showing Node A as a router and Node V as a child; each node's `state` output confirming it joined.

### Task B — Global prefix and the second address

- On the BR's `ot` CLI, run `ot netdata show`. Confirm a **global IPv6 prefix** is listed under `Prefixes:` with `paros` flags (preferred, on-mesh, SLAAC, default-route, stable). `ot br init 1 1` installs this; if it's missing, re-run that command.
- On Node A's CLI, run `ipaddr`. You should see at least **two** IPv6 addresses: the mesh-local `fd<...>::N` you've used since Lab 3, and a new one beginning with the global prefix.
- Save the global address — that's the one a client outside the mesh uses to reach `/env/temp`.
- **Evidence:** Node A `ot ipaddr` output annotated (which line is mesh-local, which is global); BR-side `ot netdata show` output showing the advertised prefix with its flags.

### Task C — End-to-end reach and the latency it costs (the headline number)

This is the trade-off the lab is built around. You measure how much latency the boundary adds, on the same `/env/temp` resource you've been hitting since Lab 3.

| Path | Where you run the client | Address you target | What you measure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **In-mesh baseline** | Node B's CLI (from Lab 3) | Node A's **mesh-local** `fd<...>::N` | `coap get` round-trip; this is your Lab 3 number, reproduce it |
| **Through the OTBR** | A Python CoAP client on your laptop (over Wi-Fi) | Node A's **global** address | Same `coap get`; the delta is the OTBR cost |
| **NAT64 to the IPv4 internet** | Node A's CLI | `ping 64:ff9b::8.8.8.8` (IPv6-encoded `8.8.8.8`) | Ping RTT; if it replies, your battery-powered sensor reached Google |

Use [tools/coap_client.py](../../tools/coap_client.py) for the laptop client — same script you ran in Lab 0.5 era, now pointed at the global address.

Fill the table below from your own measurements:

| Path | RTT (median of 10) | Δ vs in-mesh | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| In-mesh (Lab 3 reproduce) | ____ ms | 0 | baseline |
| Laptop → OTBR → Node A | ____ ms | +____ ms | the OTBR's added cost |
| Node A → NAT64 → 8.8.8.8 | ____ ms | n/a | IPv4 internet reachable from a 2×AA sensor? |

**Deliverable in your DDR:** the table above with all three rows filled in, plus one sentence stating the OTBR's measured added latency and whether it's acceptable for `/env/temp` (telemetry) vs `/act/valve` (actuation).

## 5. Deliverables — DDR updates

Update [your DDR](../3_deliverables_template.md):

- **§2 Lab Log → "Lab 5: Border Router" → To Daniela.** Two short paragraphs: can she see soil temperature from her phone via the cloud now, and how much latency the OTBR adds. Cite the Task C numbers.
- **§3 ADR-005: Single OTBR for SoilSense pilot.** Context (Daniela's market problem; Edwin's "cloud-down" worry), decision (one OTBR, no redundancy in the pilot, accept single-point-of-failure off-mesh), rationale (cite Task C numbers, the local-first property, cost), status. Note explicitly: when the OTBR dies, the mesh continues — `/act/valve` still works from a node B inside the field; only off-mesh reach is lost. Production deployments would add a second OTBR (covered in Lab 8).
- **§4 ISO Mapping.** Two new sub-sections: the Table A.3 quote + six-function scorecard from §2, and the §3 four-network table. Tag the OTBR as an **SCD-hosted IoT gateway**, not RAID; leave the Lab 2–4 SCD/ASD entries as they are. **RAID stays gray** until Labs 6–7.
- **§5 First Principles, Lab 5.** One sentence each: why a global IPv6 prefix is what makes the mesh routable from outside (it isn't a "gateway" magic, it's just SLAAC + a route); why NAT64 is needed even though Thread is IPv6 (most of the public internet isn't, yet); why the OTBR is two boards (the host has Wi-Fi but no 802.15.4 radio — classic ESP32 by recommendation, ESP32-S3 also works; the C6's radio is exposed as a spinel-over-UART RCP).
- **§6 Performance Baselines.** Fill in the "Lab 5: OTBR added latency" and "Lab 5: NAT64 RTT" rows from Task C — targets: OTBR overhead < 50 ms; NAT64 RTT < 200 ms over a typical home Wi-Fi.
- **§7 Ethics & Sustainability.** **Sustainability:** prove the mesh survives an OTBR kill — stop or unplug the BR, then land a `coap put` from Node B to Node V's *mesh-local* address. **Security:** the IDF `ot_br` example has no authenticated control surface — whoever holds the serial console controls the BR. Fine with the USB cable in your hand; a finding in production (SSH-gated serial or authenticated `otbr-web`). Flag it as a production gap. **Privacy:** the advertised global prefix routes packets from *anyone on the same Wi-Fi AP* toward your sensors — fine on the lab AP, a real concern in production; Lab 6's DTLS is the answer.
- **§8 Viewpoint Analysis (first real entry).** Lab 5 is the first lab where you write something in the §8 Viewpoint table beyond Functional. Add a row for the **enterprise system pattern** (entity-level view, Table A.3 / Figure A.5) and one for the **enterprise networking pattern** (network-level view, Table A.4 / Figure A.6). You'll fill more rows in Labs 6–8.
